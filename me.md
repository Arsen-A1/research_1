# About Me

**Arsen Bakhitbekov**
*High School Researcher & AI Enthusiast*
*NIS PhM Almaty | HSK 4 Holder*

I am a passionate explorer of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the intersection of AI with language learning. As a student at NIS PhM Almaty, I balance rigorous academic coursework with real-world problem solving.

## 🚀 Projects & Experience

### EdTech Startup: Language Learning via Short-Form Video
Currently building a startup focused on revolutionizing how people learn Chinese.
- **Problem**: Traditional language learning is static and disengaging.
- **Solution**: A platform leveraging short videos (TikTok-style) for immersive, context-rich vocabulary acquisition.
- **Tech**: Exploring NLP for auto-captioning, difficulty grading, and personalized content recommendation.

### Cross-Lingual LLM Bias Research (This Project)
An independent research initiative investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave differently across languages.
- **Goal**: Uncover "behavioral divergence" — specifically how models like Jais and Llama change their personality, safety stance, and depth of knowledge when switched from English to Russian, Chinese, or Kazakh.
- **Motivation**: As a multilingual speaker (KZ/RU/EN/CN), I noticed AI didn't just "translate" thought; it changed it. I wanted to quantify that.

## 🌏 Language & Interests

- **Languages**: 
  - Kazakh (Native)
  - Russian (Fluent)
  - English (Fluent)
  - Chinese (HSK 4 - Intermediate/Advanced)
  - *Next Goal: Arabic (To unlock research into the rich history and future of NLP in the MENA region)*

- **Interests**: 
  - **Low-Resource NLP**: Making AI work for languages often left behind (like Kazakh).
  - **Cultural Alignment**: Ensuring AI respects and understands diverse cultural norms, not just Western ones.
  - **Philosophy of AI**: Understanding the "mind" of the model.

## 🎯 Objective: MBZUAI AIR Program

I am applying to the **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) Advanced Summer Research Program**. I believe that the future of AI lies in diversity — both in the people building it and the languages it supports. I want to contribute my energy, my technical skills, and my unique perspective as a Central Asian researcher to the global AI community.
